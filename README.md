### Project overview

A curated list of data-relevant projects ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“‰

On the practical side
- Divvy Bikeshare Analyses: 

And two projects related to my research on electronic behavior in graphene and other materials ðŸ’Ž
- [Graphene Spin-Orbit Analysis](https://github.com/RMpolski/Graphene-Spin-Orbit-Analysis): Data modeling and statistical parameter estimation applied to a fun dataset I measured on twisted bilayer graphene/WSe<sub>2</sub>
- [TBG Data](https://github.com/RMpolski/TBG_Data): A repository containing links to data, analysis notebooks, and a Binder link that allows you to mess with the data and methods in a curated environment
